# MiniSB-Zero-Click
A modification of [Maverick-3D's LGX-Lite Mini Stealthburner](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Maverick/MiniSB_LGX_Lite) to be compatible with the [Zero Click](https://github.com/zruncho3d/ZeroClick/tree/main) mod.

The cowling of the LGXL has been modified to fit the ZeroClick mount, since the shape is drastically different from the originial Mini-Afterburner.
Please note that due to some dimensional changes in the miniSB, **you must use the included modified ZeroClick mount**. The remainder of the probe components are the same as
the stock Zero Click.

Additionally, to fit the dock, **one of the nozzle LED slots has been removed**. This does **NOT** affect the cooling ducts, and the other LED slot has been left in place if you wanted to add a single LED.

This mod is compatible with both the v0.1 and the v0.2; both models **must** use the included carriage

### Instructions
Assembly of the MiniSB should be very similar to the stock v0.2 toolhead; screw the LGX Lite into the cowling with 4 M3x12 BHCS's, then follow the stock [Mini Stealthburner Assembly](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-0/blob/Voron0.2/Manuals/VORON_V0.2_Assembly_Manual.pdf)

Follow all instructions for the Zero Click, [found here](https://github.com/zruncho3d/ZeroClick). Remember that you **must** use the included mount; the stock ZeroClick mount will not fit. The only notable difference is that you do not need to cut the toolhead, as the mount has already been molded to the body.
